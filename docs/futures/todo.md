# ESR — durable TODO list

**Purpose**: persist work-in-flight + future-work items across CC sessions. Created 2026-04-29 because in-memory `TaskCreate`/`TaskList` is session-scoped and items got dropped between sessions.

**Owner**: this file is updated as part of any PR that:
- Defers a piece of work it could have done (mark as future)
- Discovers a new known issue (record + link)
- Closes a previously-tracked item (move to "Done — recent" or remove)

**Conventions**:
- One-line items with `[file:line](path)` or `[Spec §]` references when useful.
- "Status" column: `pending` / `in-flight` / `blocked` / `deferred`.
- `In flight` items name the PR / branch they live on.

## In flight (current PR)

(none — PR-21w shipped)

## Pending — concrete next PRs

| What | Tracked PR | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Esr.Peers.CapGuard` — extract Lane B from `Esr.PeerServer:243` | PR-21x | Larger refactor; touches `PeerServer` state shape. Includes `deny_dm_last_emit` rate-limit migration. |
| Cap principal_id rekey: caps stored under `linyilun` instead of `ou_*` post-bind | PR-21y | Currently PR-21s does **graceful resolution** at check time (open_id → username). Storing under username would require migrating capabilities.yaml + all envelope construction sites. |
| `describe_topology` filter for `users.yaml` | PR-21z | Spec §"Out of scope". feishu_ids are sensitive — should NOT be exposed via the MCP `describe_topology` tool. Default-deny. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-28-session-cwd-worktree-redesign.md` §"Out of scope". |
| `AdapterChannelNewChainTest` known-flake formal entry | done | Now in `docs/operations/known-flakes.md`. |

## Pending — design discussions before PR

| What | Why deferred | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Auto-bind feishu Option B/C (full automation with confirmation DM) | PR-21i shipped Option D (instructional DM only) | Original brainstorm in conversation 2026-04-29 ~02:00. User chose Option D for now. Revisit if instructional-DM friction is still too high after live use. |
| OAuth-based esr user registration | Spec §"Out of scope" | Manual `esr user add` for now. Real OAuth needs Feishu Open Platform integration. |
| Deprecate `cc_tmux` Python adapter | PR-21e mentioned as "out of scope" | `cc_mcp + TmuxProcess` is the new path. cc_tmux still referenced by `worker_supervisor.ex:46` + tests. Cleanup PR if it's truly dead. |
| `tag=` alias removal in slash parser (D14) | PR-21d kept it as rollout-friendly alias | After all real callers migrate to `name=`, drop the alias. Currently still used by `final_gate.sh` `--param` tags (different layer; not slash). Verify before removal. |

## Pending — observability / ops

| What | Notes |
|---|---|
| `ChannelClient` align with phx-py reference | `docs/futures/channel-client-phx-py-alignment.md` — full audit of self-hosted Phoenix client vs phx-py best practices. PR-21l fixed heartbeat; per-call timeout + connection-state events still missing. |
| ExDoc-based runtime API docs | Currently `gen-docs.sh` only covers click CLI + `cli_channel.ex` dispatch topics. Other internal modules have no auto-docs. |
| Per-session role override | Workspace dictates `role:` today; per-session override mentioned in spec out-of-scope. |
| Cross-workspace branch sharing | Speculative; spec out-of-scope. |
| Worktree GC sweep | Periodic prune of branchless worktrees. Operator runs `git worktree prune` manually for now. |
