# ESR — durable TODO list

**Purpose**: persist work-in-flight + future-work items across CC sessions. Created 2026-04-29 because in-memory `TaskCreate`/`TaskList` is session-scoped and items got dropped between sessions.

**Owner**: this file is updated as part of any PR that:
- Defers a piece of work it could have done (mark as future)
- Discovers a new known issue (record + link)
- Closes a previously-tracked item (move to "Done — recent" or remove)

**Conventions**:
- One-line items with `[file:line](path)` or `[Spec §]` references when useful.
- "Status" column: `pending` / `in-flight` / `blocked` / `deferred`.
- `In flight` items name the PR / branch they live on.

## In flight (current PR)

(none — PR-21β shipped, see Done section below)

## Pending — concrete next PRs

| What | Tracked PR | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Migrate `Esr.WorkerSupervisor` (adapter + handler) to `Esr.OSProcess` (erlexec) | done | PR-21β — `spawn_worker.sh` + pidfile + `cleanup_orphans` deleted; erlexec-managed DynamicSupervisor pattern; `ESR_SPAWN_TOKEN` Python guards. Net -230 LOC. See `docs/notes/erlexec-worker-lifecycle.md`. |
| Investigate: why E2E missed multi-adapter orphan duplication | pending | See task #222. Audit final_gate.sh + tests/e2e/ for assertions that would catch "1 user message → N replies" — likely none. May get folded into the lifecycle migration PR's testing chapter. |
| Spec: structured error/notification response system | pending design | Task #220. "error: unauthorized" 粒度不够; design ToolUseResponse/AssistantResponse-style envelope to compose 错误 + 操作建议. Brainstorm separately. |
| Spec: unify slash-command business logic into topology yaml | pending design | Task #221. Move slash routing from Elixir code into yaml so future changes don't need esrd restart. Brainstorm separately. |
| `Esr.Peers.CapGuard` — extract Lane B from `Esr.PeerServer` | done | PR-21x #101. `deny_dm_last_emit` migrated; rate-limit globally consistent. |
| Cap principal_id rekey: caps stored under `linyilun` instead of `ou_*` post-bind | done | PR-21y #102. `bind-feishu` migrates existing `ou_xxx` caps + grants bootstrap under username. `unbind-feishu` revokes bootstrap when last binding goes. `cap grant ou_*` emits operator hint. PR-21s graceful resolve stays as backstop. |
| `describe_topology` filter for `users.yaml` | done | PR-21z #103. Allowlist hardened in `filter_workspace_for_describe/1` + 5 regression tests + `docs/notes/describe-topology-security.md`. |
| `AdapterChannelNewChainTest` known-flake formal entry | done | Now in `docs/operations/known-flakes.md`. |

## Pending — design discussions before PR

| What | Why deferred | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Auto-bind feishu Option B/C (full automation with confirmation DM) | PR-21i shipped Option D (instructional DM only) | Original brainstorm in conversation 2026-04-29 ~02:00. User chose Option D for now. Revisit if instructional-DM friction is still too high after live use. |
| OAuth-based esr user registration | Spec §"Out of scope" | Manual `esr user add` for now. Real OAuth needs Feishu Open Platform integration. |
| Deprecate `cc_tmux` Python adapter | PR-21e mentioned as "out of scope" | `cc_mcp + TmuxProcess` is the new path. cc_tmux still referenced by `worker_supervisor.ex:46` + tests. Cleanup PR if it's truly dead. |
| `tag=` alias removal in slash parser (D14) | done | PR-21α #104. Removed in slash parser; `final_gate.sh` `--param tag=` is `cmd run` template layer, untouched. |
| **Yaml file visualization / pretty-print** | New 2026-04-30 | Today operators `cat ~/.esrd/<env>/workspaces.yaml` etc. to inspect runtime state. After PR-21κ ships, the yaml surface grows: `slash-routes.yaml` + `workspaces.yaml` + `users.yaml` + `capabilities.yaml` + `agents.yaml` + `adapters.yaml` — cross-references hard to follow. Candidates: (a) `/topology` slash that renders all the connections, (b) `esr show` CLI that pretty-prints with cross-refs, (c) mermaid/graphviz diagrams generated at boot, (d) web view via Phoenix LiveView. Brainstorm + scope decision needed before implementation. |

## Pending — observability / ops

| What | Notes |
|---|---|
| `ChannelClient` align with phx-py reference | `docs/futures/channel-client-phx-py-alignment.md` — full audit of self-hosted Phoenix client vs phx-py best practices. PR-21l fixed heartbeat; per-call timeout + connection-state events still missing. |
| ExDoc-based runtime API docs | Currently `gen-docs.sh` only covers click CLI + `cli_channel.ex` dispatch topics. Other internal modules have no auto-docs. |
| Per-session role override | Workspace dictates `role:` today; per-session override mentioned in spec out-of-scope. |
| Cross-workspace branch sharing | Speculative; spec out-of-scope. |
| Worktree GC sweep | Periodic prune of branchless worktrees. Operator runs `git worktree prune` manually for now. |
